OMG just walked out of Hurry Up Tomorrow and my head’s still spinning like a blender with no lid. popcorn stuck in my hair, what a mess. So this   think Inception meets Loony Tunes. Seriously, half the time I didn't know if I was 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 a dream or just napping with my eyes open. My back is killing me from those stupid theater seats, feel like I've been in a boxing match with a cactus.

The noise, ye gods. Why are people incapable of silence, are they allergic to it? The scenes kept merging together like someone mixed watercolors in a puddle, and I swear the guy next to me was literally chewing glass or that’s how it sounded when the protagonist's car exploded and his dog just freaking flew into an alternate reality. But that soundtrack, though. Like an alien orchestra led by a hedgehog, it’s stuck in my head now. I need that in my life soundtrack or nightmare, what’s the diff?

> And then there’s this scene where Jessica, wait or was it Rebecca? Ugh, names, she looks at this sunflower and it just explodes into a thousand butterflies, felt like my brain when I realized I lost my car keys again. But who needs them when you can 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   and 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   at home, right? That way you can google what the heck just happened between scenes, honestly probably a good plan.

The time loop thing, I'm usually a sucker for it, but my head was lagging like a 2006 internet connection. Almost forgot who I was. Like, was Ernest the dog or that boy they found hitchhiking through dimensions... whatever, dogs are great and deserve their own  s. So, imagine a lollipop melting during a sunstorm - that’s kinda how the pacing felt in the last twenty minutes. I mean, they could've wrapped it up faster but who am I to judge, my life is just a 𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘮 of half-finished projects.

𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   and ponder life’s mysteries at 2 a.m.- it’s the feeling that sticks.
